/**
 * AIController manages AI decision-making and move execution for intelligent Tetris gameplay.
 * 
 * This controller bridges the gap between AI decision-making and actual game actions.
 * It works in two phases:
 * 1. PLANNING: Uses TetrisAI to determine the optimal move for the current piece
 * 2. EXECUTION: Breaks down the planned move into sequential game actions (rotate, move, drop)
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Lazy planning: Only calculates new moves when pieces change
 * - Sequential execution: Performs rotations first, then horizontal movement, finally dropping
 * - State management: Tracks execution progress and resets between pieces
 * - Error handling: Gracefully handles invalid moves and game state changes
 * 
 * The AI execution is deliberately sequential to make the moves visible and debuggable.
