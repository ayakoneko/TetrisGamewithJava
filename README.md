# üéÆ Tetris Game with JavaFX

An enhanced **Tetris clone** built in **Java** with **JavaFX**, developed as part of the  
7010ICT / 7805ICT Object-Oriented Software Development course.  
The project implements both several features following OOP principles, design patterns, and advanced programming practices.

## üìå Project Overview

This project recreates the classic Tetris experience with a modernized UI and extended gameplay.  
It was developed incrementally across two milestones:

- **Milestone 1**: Core Tetris gameplay with menus, scoring, and basic features.  
- **Milestone 2**: Extended system with advanced features (AI play, multiplayer, server, persistency, etc.).

## ‚ú® Features

### Milestone 1 (Core Requirements)
- Splash screen with course & team details
- Main menu (Play, Configurations, High Scores, Exit)
- Configuration screen (field size, level, music, sound, AI mode, extended mode)
- High score screen (top 10, dummy data acceptable)
- Gameplay (10x20 grid, smooth tetromino controls)
- Full row detection and erasure
- Pause/resume and exit confirmation dialogs

### Milestone 2 (Enhanced Features)
- Persistency: Save/load configurations and high scores via JSON
- Dynamic resizing (adjustable field sizes, one/two-player mode)
- Background music & sound effects (toggles with **M** and **S** keys)
- Real-time scoring & high score persistence
- AI Player (achieves ‚â• 500 points automatically)
- Networking with **TetrisServer.jar** for external players
- Two-player mode (human vs human, AI vs human, AI vs AI, external vs AI, etc.)
- Design principles applied (SOLID & GRASP)
- Design patterns: Singleton, Factory, State/Command, etc.
- Advanced programming practices: Threads, Streams, Lambdas, CSS, Generics
- Full JUnit testing suite with coverage reports

## üöÄ Run the Game

### Requirements
- Java 11+
- JavaFX SDK
- Maven

### Steps
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ayakoneko/TetrisGamewithJava.git
cd TetrisGamewithJava

# Build with Maven
mvn clean install

# Run the game
mvn javafx:run
```

Or run the prebuilt JAR:
```bash
java -jar target/TetrisJava.jar
```

If using **external players**:
```bash
java -jar TetrisServer.jar
```

## üìä Architecture & Design

- **Architecture**: MVC with clear separation of Model, View, and Controller  
- **Design Principles**: SOLID & GRASP applied for maintainability  
- **Patterns Used**: Singleton (Game Manager), Factory (Tetromino creation), State/Command (UI/game updates), etc.  
- **Advanced Programming**: Threads for responsiveness, JSON for persistence, Streams/Lambdas for cleaner code, CSS for UI styling  

---

## ‚úÖ Testing

- JUnit tests for core methods  
- Parameterized tests and mocks (Mockito) for advanced coverage
